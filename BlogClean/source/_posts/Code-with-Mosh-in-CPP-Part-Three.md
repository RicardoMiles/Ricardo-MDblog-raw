## What is OOP

Program paradigm - Style of programming

* Procedural
* Functional
* Object-Oriented
* Event-Driven 

Functional and OOP is the two most popular ones nowadays 

**Object** - A software entity that has **attributes** and **functions**

* attributes - properties
* function - methods

Class - A class is a blueprint or recipe for creating objects



We can represent a classs using vision language called UML - which is short for Unified Modelling Language 

In UML, we use a box with three sections, on the top we have the class name, in the middle section we list attributes or variables that holds data, at bottom section we list functions. These variables and functions are called **members of the class**

**Structure is more about data, Class is more about DATA+BEHAVIOR**. This is one of the core principles of OOP called **Encapsulation** (Combining the data and functions that operate on the data into one unite)

An object is an instance of class 

In UML we call the data part attributes, in C++ we call them member variable, in other languages we call them fields or properties. All of those terminology is the same - a variable inside a class

 Methods = Member functions 

## Define a Class

Use Clion's feature of creating a C++ class will automatically create a `Classname.h` headerfile and a `Classname .cpp` file with same name which is linked. We can also do these thing manually.

In the headerfile, we are going to define the features of class. We are gonna include this headerfile later

we have header guard
