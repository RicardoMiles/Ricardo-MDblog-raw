### **Concept of a Pointer**

A **pointer** in C and C++ is a variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable. Instead of holding a direct value like regular variables, a pointer "points" to a memory location where the value is stored.

#### **Key Concepts of Pointers:**

1. **Memory Address**: Every variable resides at a specific memory location, identified by its address.
2. **Pointer Variable**: A variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
3. **Dereferencing**: Accessing or modifying the value at the memory address stored in the pointer.
