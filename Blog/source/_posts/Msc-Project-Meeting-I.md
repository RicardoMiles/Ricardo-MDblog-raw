## Sections should be included

### Abstract

### Background

Background section talks about what method  I used, what data I used, and some related theory/concept

#### EEG (general concept) and what it is

#### Theory of Machine Learning & Neural Network &  RNN & LSTM

#### What is LSTM

### Methodology

Methodology section talks about actual work I've done, specificly LSTM implement

### Result

### Discuss

### Ethnics

There are two professors George contacted. They said it is happy to give me advice. But it is not top priority should be considered right now. One of them is Andrew Charlesworth, another is Emi Tonkin.

### Conclusion



## Tasks

* Getting familiar with neural network

* Having a rough understanding of RNN

* Having my own research on machine learning

* Focus on Session Two “Food Choice” part of dataset

* Make sure the submission date of delayed project

* Make sure the reassessment period of CA and C and JAVA

* Write a proposal for myself - George said there is no need to do weekly report, but motivation and schedule for myself is more vital
