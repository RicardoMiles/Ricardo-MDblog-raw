`getline(cin, bookfair[i].title);` **前面如果用过 `cin >>`，要加 `cin.ignore()`，但你全部用 `getline()`，很好，避免了这个问题。**



## 🧱 Operator Overloading: Grammar and Syntax (Explained)

Let’s break down this definition:

```cpp
ReturnType operatorSymbol (const TypeName& other) {
    // logic
}
```

### 🔎 Key Grammar Rules:

| Element                 | Meaning                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ReturnType`            | What the operator gives back. e.g. a `Book`, `bool`, etc. |
| `operator+`             | The operator being redefined (e.g. `+`, `==`, `>`)        |
| `const TypeName& other` | The object on the right-hand side (`b1 + b2`)             |
| `this` (hidden)         | The object on the left-hand side (`b1`)                   |

Example in plain English:

```cpp
Book operator+(const Book& other);
```

> “This function tells C++ how to add another `Book` to `this Book` using `+`.”





I don't know what is so-called `this`, I've wrote OOP code with JAVA, but I've never deeply and genuinely comprehend what is `this` and my comprehension of OOP is skin-deep

Brilliant question. You're not alone — a lot of people write OOP code for a while without fully understanding what `this` really is. Let's fix that now. I’ll explain `this` deeply but clearly, from first principles, and compare it with Java since you have that background.

------

## 🔍 What is `this`?

### ✅ **Definition**:

In both **C++** and **Java**, `this` is a **special pointer/reference** inside an object’s **non-static** member function.

It **refers to the current object** — the one that is calling the function.

------

## 💡 Think of it like this:

You have many books. Each book has its own `title`, `author`, and `price`.

When you call:

```
cpp


复制编辑
book1.printInfo();
```

C++ passes a hidden pointer called `this` into the `printInfo()` function, pointing to `book1`.

So internally, this happens:

```
cpp复制编辑Book::printInfo(Book* this) {
    cout << this->title << " written by " << this->author << ...;
}
```

You don’t *have* to use `this->` — but that’s what’s happening under the hood.

## 🧠 Java vs C++ Comparison

| Concept        | Java                                 | C++                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `this`         | implicit reference to current object | implicit pointer to current object            |
| Type           | `Book` (reference)                   | `Book*` (pointer)                             |
| Usage          | `this.title`                         | `this->title`                                 |
| Static methods | Can’t use `this`                     | Same — `this` doesn’t exist in static methods |
| Return `this`  | return `this;`                       | return `*this;` if returning object           |

### ⚠️ Key Difference:

- In Java, everything is a reference → `this` is just a reference to the current object.
- In C++, `this` is an **explicit pointer** — you must use `*this` or `this->`.

------

## 🧪 Example: `this` in C++

```
cpp复制编辑struct Book {
    string title;
    float price;

    void show() {
        cout << "Book: " << this->title << endl;
    }

    Book& setPrice(float p) {
        this->price = p;
        return *this;
    }
};
cpp复制编辑Book b;
b.setPrice(9.99).show();  // Chaining is possible because we returned *this
```

### Explanation:

- `this->price = p;` → assign to the field of the current object
- `return *this;` → return the object itself (dereference the pointer)

------

## 🪜 Visual Analogy

Imagine a class as a blueprint. `this` is like saying:

> “The house currently being built / modified.”

Even if you write 100 books in code, each one has its own identity. `this` helps the function know *which one* it's working on.

------

## 😈 Common Misunderstandings

| ❌ Wrong Idea               | ✅ Correct Understanding                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `this` is static           | `this` only exists in instance (non-static) methods      |
| `this` is global           | No — each object has its own version                     |
| You must always use `this` | No — only when necessary (e.g. name conflicts, chaining) |

------

## 🧪 Mini Exercise (C++)

Write a struct `Student` with:

- Fields: `name`, `score`
- A method `setScore(float score)` that:
  - uses `this->score = score;`
  - returns `*this`
- A method `print()` that prints name and score

Then in `main()`, chain the methods:

```
cpp复制编辑Student s;
s.setScore(90).print();
```

Want me to give you a solution after you try? Or shall I walk you through writing it now?

Let me know if you want to go even deeper — like `this` inside constructors, operator overloading, or inheritance.
