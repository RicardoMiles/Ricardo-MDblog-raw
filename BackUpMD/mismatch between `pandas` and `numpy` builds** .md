Excellent debugging trace — this tells us **exactly** what’s wrong.

The key line is:

> ```
> ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject
> ```

------

### ⚠️ What this means

You currently have **a mismatch between `pandas` and `numpy` builds** inside your `.venv`.
 This happens when:

- `pandas` was compiled against a different version of `numpy` than what is currently installed, or
- one of them (usually `pandas`) was built from source under macOS ARM without a matching wheel.

------

### ✅ Easiest Fix (Recommended)

1. **Activate your `.venv`**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

1. **Reinstall both `numpy` and `pandas` cleanly**

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip uninstall -y numpy pandas
pip install numpy==1.26.4 pandas==2.0.3
```

> ✅ These two versions (`numpy 1.26.4`, `pandas 2.0.3`) are confirmed compatible and have **precompiled ARM wheels** for macOS, so no C compilation is needed.

1. Try running your app again:

```bash
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
```

It should now start successfully and open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

------

### ✅ Alternative if issue persists

If you still see a similar error after that:

```bash
pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir numpy pandas
```

This forces pip to rebuild the dependency tree cleanly.

------

### ⚙️ (Optional but Good Practice)

Add these to your `requirements.txt` for reproducibility:

```
fastapi==0.111.1
uvicorn==0.24.0
numpy==1.26.4
pandas==2.0.3
openpyxl==3.1.3
python-multipart==0.0.7
```

------

Once it runs, you’ll be able to upload `.xlsx` files in `/docs` and preview your first dataset — completing **Day 1** 🎯

Would you like me to give you the exact test steps (how to upload and confirm the API is working correctly)?
