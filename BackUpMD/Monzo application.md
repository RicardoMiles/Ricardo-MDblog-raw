1. 说明你**会哪些编程语言**（例如 Python、SQL、R、Java 等）；举出**实际项目或工作中**用到这些语言的**具体例子**；如果你有 GitHub 或类似网站的作品集，也可以**提供链接**来展示你的编程和数据分析能力。（300个 English word）

I am proficient in several programming languages, including **Python**, **SQL (MySQL)**, **C++**, and have practical experience with **Power Query**, **Power BI**, and **Qt** for data visualization and automation.

In my current role, I focus on optimizing data pipelines and analytical dashboards. I developed custom **MySQL scripts** to extract and aggregate lightweight datasets from iFOP and iSC platforms, improving the **Udata dashboard’s** data-fetching speed and significantly reducing system bugs. By directly querying from base tables, I minimized pipeline load and enhanced data retrieval efficiency.

Using **Python**, I built an automated **iterative daily report parser** that processes natural-language warehouse reports. The system applies a top-down tokeniser and parser for data normalization, demonstrating robust natural-language processing (NLP) and data-cleaning capabilities.

I also programmed a **C++-based scheduling tool** to help warehouse teams generate shift timetables efficiently, ensuring flexibility and time savings in manpower allocation. Additionally, I designed an **automated analytics pipeline** with **Power Query** and **Power BI** to monitor non-standard logistics product lead times in real time, enabling hour-level visual insights for backlog and shipment performance.

Beyond operational systems, I combined **Python**, **Qt**, and the **OpenStreetMap API** to create an **interactive vector map** analysing the warehouse and store distribution of competitor Coolblue. The visualization is publicly available on my GitHub portfolio: https://ricardomiles.github.io/Supply-Chain-Analysis/.

Finally, I developed an **iterative Excel-based productivity and manpower ramp-up model** to monitor labour performance during major campaigns and led a **network redundancy test** for Luton warehouse dual-fiber failover optimisation.

Together, these projects reflect my technical versatility, data-driven mindset, and ability to integrate software engineering with real-world operational analytics.

2. 为什么想在Monzo求职

I’m genuinely excited about the opportunity to join Monzo because it combines two of my biggest passions — data and meaningful impact. I love using data analysis not just to understand problems, but to predict outcomes, monitor performance, and design smarter solutions. The idea of improving financial products and user experiences through data perfectly aligns with my interests.

My background closely matches Monzo’s data culture. In my current role at JD.com, I’ve worked on rebuilding Power Query pipelines and applying analytical tools to solve real operational problems. This experience taught me how to connect data, technology, and business — translating complex insights into visual stories and clear trends that non-technical teams can easily understand and act on.

As a loyal Monzo user myself, I’ve always admired how Monzo uses transparency, design, and technology to make money work better for everyone. I believe Monzo’s data-driven and customer-first approach creates endless opportunities to innovate. Joining the Data team would allow me to contribute to that mission while continuing to grow as a data professional.
